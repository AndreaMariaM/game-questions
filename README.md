## Game Purpose:
Apocalypse game is meant to be for 4+ players. Everyone should register and login with an email address and make a username that contains their first name. One person clicks generate game code and sends it to the players and everyone enters the code to join together. The batting order is chosen randomly, one player being the “master” in each round. The goal of the game is to guess everyone’s answers right and reach 15 points first. The master chooses a question from 3 and the question is shown to everyone and everyone types in their answer besides for the master. Once all the answers are in, the master sees them without who wrote it and has to match the answer to the person for all the players. If they get 0 right they win 0 points,  ¼ of them right (see the points breakdown for # of players. The fraction of the players gets rounded.), they win 4 points, ½ right and they win 6 points, and all right they win 8 points. The game goes around for who plays the master and is over once someone wins 15 points total.
